Other notes
TradingAlgorithm.on_dt_changed() is called by the simulation loop, this would need to be called by something similar to
simulation.

AlgorithmSimulator (in zipline/gens/tradesimulation.py)
used as the trading_client in TradingAlgorithm, the trading_client has methods/attributes called in the following places
 in TradingAlgorithm:
line 593: transform(), creates a generator work loop for TradingAlgorithm._create_generator()
line 1321: current_data.current(asset, "price") used to get the last price of asset
line 1477: current_data used to validate_order_params
line 2153: current_data used in validate_account_controls
